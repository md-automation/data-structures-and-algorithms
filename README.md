# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. It is designed for anyone interested in learning and practicing data structures and algorithms.

## Structure

The repository is divided into two main sections:
- **Data Structures**: This includes fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: This section covers key algorithms including sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.

## How to Use

Each folder contains Python scripts with implementations of specific data structures or algorithms. Each script includes example usage to demonstrate how the implementation works.

### Example Usage

You can run any of the scripts using Python to see the data structures and algorithms in action. For instance, to see the quick sort algorithm, navigate to the `Sorting` folder and run:

```bash
python quick_sort.py
